Resources for the Immigrants at Bard Library Workshop

https://libguides.bard.edu/immigrantsatbard

Bard has a long history of welcoming immigrants, especially those escaping difficult circumstances in their home countries. This history dates back to the early to mid 1900s, when Bard welcomed many Jewish intellectuals from Europe who were escaping the Nazis and other political persecution in their home countries including Germany, Italy, and Hungary. Many of these people became prominent figures at Bard and in their fields here in the U.S. One example very near and dear to our hearts in the library is Felix Hirsch, who came from Germany in 1934 and was the head librarian at the college from 1936-1954.

Today we’ll be honoring this history as a way to teach you about the library’s resources. You’ll be working in teams to research prominent artists, intellectuals and writers who were immigrants or lived in exile here in the United States. All the people you’ll be researching today have some tie to the Bard community. They taught here, lived here, or studied here. Some of them are even buried in the cemetery on campus! For the rest of this session you’ll be working in groups to research one of these people. You’ll be using several different types of sources. We’ll be walking through this process together and sharing your results along the way, so you can all learn from each other.
